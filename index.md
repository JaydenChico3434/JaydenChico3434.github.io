I am a computer science major at CSUF. I plan to graduate in 2027 spring. I like cats and other cute animals like kiwis.

 ### CPSC 120

1. _Lab 3 Part-1_
* There are many things that I liked in this lab. To name a few I like the application and the calculator. This is good because this allowed me and my partner, Jesus Lopez, to see real-world applications of the code we could use or make in the real world. The code introduced functions, which is very useful because this was a big stepping stone for the next labs.

2. _Lab 6 Part-1_
* My partner, Josue Alonso, and I worked with using the arguments. This was good to see in practice because we were used to the ./a.out command. Using arguments allows us to have command line inputs which was nice to have. Also learning the position was important. For example, "./a.out mayo wheat" mayo would be 1 while ./a.out is 0.

3. _Lab 7_
* Me And Jesus Lopez worked with the sign's logic. Something that I liked was the logical processes that took place. Bool is a data type that is either 1 or 0 and we were able to make some code that could check some conditions that we wanted to be met. It was a great introduction to these complicated processes.
