## Favorite Labs 
I am a computer science major at CSUF. I plan to graduate in 2027 spring. I like cats and other cute animals like kiwis. 

* Lab 3 Part-1
- There are many things that I liked in this lab. To name a few I like the application and the calculator. This is good becasue this allowed me and my partner, Jesus Lopez, to see real word applications of the code that we could use or make in the real world. The code introduced functions and this is very useful becasue this was a big stepping stone for the next labs. 

* Lab 6 Part-1 
- Me and my partner, Josue Alonso, worked with using the arguments. This was good to see in practice becasue we were used to the ./a.out command. Using arguments allows us to have command line inputs which was nice to have. Also learning the position was importants. For example, "./a.out mayo wheat" mayo would be 1 while ./a.out is 0. 

* Lab 7 
- Me and Jesus Lopez worked with the signs logic. Something that I really liked was the logical processes that took place. Bool is a data type that is either 1 or 0 and we were able to make some code that could check some condtions that we wanted to be met. It was a great introduction for these complicated processes.
